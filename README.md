Student Depression Prediction Model
This project leverages a machine learning model to predict depression among students based on various demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors. It utilizes a dataset containing features such as gender, age, academic pressure, work pressure, sleep duration, and financial stress.

The model aims to support early identification and intervention for mental health challenges faced by students. The dataset is processed and analyzed to extract meaningful insights, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Features of the Dataset
Demographics: Gender, Age, City, etc.
Academic Metrics: CGPA, Academic Pressure, Study Satisfaction.
Lifestyle Factors: Sleep Duration, Dietary Habits, Work/Study Hours.
Mental Health Indicators: Depression Status (Target Variable), Suicidal Thoughts, Financial Stress, Family History of Mental Illness.
Steps in the Project
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (e.g., imputation for Financial Stress).
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze relationships between features.
Visualize trends and correlations.
Model Building:

Supervised machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Evaluation:

Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Achieved 83% accuracy on the test dataset.
